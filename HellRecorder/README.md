# Hell Recorder
Current version: v1.1

This program is a fun project that I created for myself that is related to a video game that I enjoy playing called Dungeon Fighter Online.

To obtain end-game gear in this game, you have to run Hell Modes which drop epic equipment and various other items related to Hell Mode.
This program records the important information of each Hell Mode run and calculates statistics to help keep track of how a player's Hell Mode experience is going.

This program is created by Erick Chong, an Undergraduate Computer Science student at USC.
