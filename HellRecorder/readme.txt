Hell Recorder v1.5

Some notes about the program:

. In config.txt, you can change what file the program reads from and writes to. By default, it is "log.txt". Simply change "log.txt" to whatever you want after the "FILENAME = " in config.txt.

. The filename that is provided in config.txt will contain all data from each hell mode. The format is as follows in this order:

The run number, dfficulty, amount of demon invitations, amount of demon eyes, amount of hell orbs, and the epic(s).

If no epic was recorded for a particular hell run, then it will simply say "None". Multiple epics are separated by "/".


. The Statistics button lists all of the epics that you have recorded in the program in a table. You can choose to display all epics, only epics from hardcore, or only epics from insane. Additionally, you can sort epics by run or alphabetically.

. If you have added a run using the program and want to update the Statistics window with the latest run(s), then the "Update Table" button is what you press to do so.

. The data of each run that is recorded into the file specified in config.txt is in a specific format that I made myself. All columns are supposed to line up. This is only the case if the default font for Notepad is used which is: Consolas. If using another text editor, then I can't really help.

. When the program is opened, the program reads in the data that is currently specified in config.txt. If you make any changes to the file specified in config.txt while the program is running, the program will not account for it.


Thanks for using this program and good luck in your hell runs!
